This folder contains code + functions specific for improving DFM in the CL scenario. 
In this scenario, novelty is comprised of a single class. 


1. How to best threshold for Novel/old classification
2. What metric to threshold on (min score, var/entropy/kurtosis/etc measured on score distribution)
3. classify in AL rounds? 
    3.1. Can most "certain" samples be selected first? 
    3.2. or initial round of random? 
    3.3. or some other criteria for AL choice 
    3.4. Improve CL-DFM with this initial AL-round (can allow new-PCA parameters to recruit novel samples or guide novelty classification)




For future work:
------------------
***If this were to be extended to the online scenario, we would need a online-memory buffer (short-term memory) to evaluate some sort of local distribution. 
Like forming a window over which to evaluate if there was a score shift. 
save short-term scores until buffer is filled and with some smoothing we can evaluate if the DFM-scores have shifted and establish "novelty". 
Have some knowledge of distribution shift periodicity. 
This can be applied to the patent idea for the self driving cars (assume environments cannot change that abruptly)
