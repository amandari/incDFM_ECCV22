1. Run coreset supervised finetuning (raw images)
2. Rewrite classifier class to be able to swap pretrained embeddings etc. 
    2.1. Maybe separate into backbone vs. classifier classes
    2.2. Then have parent class that loads both in 

3. Write L2-SP optimization loss for few-data adaptation transfer. 

4. How can what I'm doing transfer to few-shot literature.... If L2-SP reg works with few-shot tasks using contrastive learning ...
5. propose other pretext tasks? The clustering approach from PCL is very interesting --> EM algorithm
